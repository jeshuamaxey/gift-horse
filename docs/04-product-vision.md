# Product Vision

## Problem Statement

Gift-horse solves the fiddly nature of capturing and organizing gift ideas for loved ones throughout the course of a year. Managing a long list of gift ideas becomes challenging when:

- Gifts exist in different states (ideas, purchased, gifted, abandoned)
- Managing multiple recipients (especially around holidays like Christmas)
- Information is scattered and hard to organize
- The current solution is often just "a very long note app"

## Solution Philosophy

Gift-horse is **not** a gift suggestion engine or social wishlist platform. It is a personal gift idea management tool designed to be exceptionally good at a few core things:

1. **Lightning-fast capture**: Go from idea → stored in app with minimal friction
2. **Person-centric organization**: All ideas for a person collated in one place for quick browsing

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Quick Capture
- Minimal taps and typing required
- Support multiple capture methods (image sharing, photo, text, voice)
- Optimized workflow from "I have an idea" to "it's saved"

### 2. Person-Centric View
- Single view per person showing all gift ideas
- Organized by upcoming occasions and recency
- Easy to browse when gift-giving time arrives

## Target User

Individuals who give gifts to multiple people (family, friends, etc.) throughout the year and need a better way to track and organize their gift ideas than a notes app.

## Success Metrics

- Time to capture an idea: < 10 seconds
- All gift ideas for a person viewable in one screen
- Quick access to most relevant ideas (by occasion and recency)
